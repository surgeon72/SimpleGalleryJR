# SimpleGalleryJR
Android Test Project for JetRuby

Displaying images which stored in folder "DCIM/Camera" on sd card.
Images displayed in two columns in grid (GridView layout).
App can show selected pics in full screen mode.

App was targeted for API 14 (ICS) and above. 
Created in Android Studio.

To see whole app, please download SimpleGalleryJR.rar

P.S. There is some problem with 1st picture in grid, when you touch it,
nothing is going on, but if you touch any other picture, it will appear in full screen,
and right in moment after that you also see 1st picture in fullscreen. 
I can't deal with it.
